== Client Side Filtering

It is always a good practice to send to the client only information which they are supposed
to have access to.  In this lesson, too much information is being sent to the client, creating
a serious access control problem. For this exercise, your mission is exploit the extraneous information being returned
by the server to discover information to which you should not have access.

You are logged in as Moe Stooge, CSO of Goat Hills Financial. You have access to everyone in the company's information,
except the CEO, Neville Bartholomew.  Or at least you shouldn't have access to the CEO's information. For this assignment,
examine the contents of the page to see what extra information you can find.
